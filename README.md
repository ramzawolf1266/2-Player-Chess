2-Player Chess Program

Overview

This program is a web-based chess game for two players, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project provides a functional chessboard with draggable pieces, basic move validation, and a clean user interface. The initial design focuses on human-vs-human play, with the potential for expansion to include AI opponents or advanced rules.

Features

Interactive Chessboard: A visually appealing 8x8 chessboard grid, styled to match traditional chessboard aesthetics.

Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Players can move pieces across the board by dragging and dropping them into valid positions.

Initial Board Setup: The chessboard is initialized with all pieces in their standard starting positions.

Move Validation: Basic validation ensures that pieces cannot remain in the same position after a move. This can be extended to implement full chess rules.

Dynamic Rendering: The board updates in real-time after each move, reflecting the current game state.
